Part A

1.	Transform the conceptual design (ER diagram) into a relational model by converting the entities and relationships into their 
appropriate tables. Show if your tables are normalized using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. 

ER diagram into a relational schema:

Entity Conversion:

Each entity becomes a table.
Each attribute of the entity becomes a column in the table.
The primary key of the entity becomes the primary key of the table.
Relationship Conversion:

One-to-many relationships add the primary key of the "one" side to the "many" side as a foreign key.
Many-to-many relationships are represented by a new table that contains the primary keys of the two entities involved as its primary key.
Based on the ER diagram provided, we can identify the following entities and relationships:

Entities:

Books
Publisher
Member
Relationships:

Books are published by Publishers.
Books are borrowed by Members.
The tables created from these entities and relationships would likely look like this:

Books Table:

Book_ID (Primary Key)
Title
Author
Price
Availability
ISBN
Publisher_ID (Foreign Key)
Publisher Table:

Publisher_ID (Primary Key)
PublisherName
PublisherAddress
Member Table:

Memb_ID (Primary Key)
Member_Name
Address
Memb_Type
Memb_Join_Date
Borrowed By Table:

Book_ID (Foreign Key)
Memb_ID (Foreign Key)
Issue/Loan Date
Due Date
Return Date

Normalization arranging the attributes of the tables to meet the criteria reducing redundancy and improve data integrity.

1st Normal Form (1NF):

Each table has a primary key: unique values and no part of the primary key may be null.
No repeating groups or arrays.
2nd Normal Form (2NF):

It is in 1NF.
All non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key (meaning the entire key is needed to identify a record).
3rd Normal Form (3NF):

It is in 2NF.
There are no transitive functional dependencies (a non-key column should not depend on another non-key column).
Normalization Analysis:

The Books table is in 1NF because it has a primary key (Book_ID) and no repeating groups.
It is in 2NF because all attributes depend on the primary key.
It is in 3NF if there are no columns that are dependent on non-primary key columns, which seems to be the case.
The same analysis would apply to the Publisher and Member tables, ensuring they follow the primary key, no 
repeating groups, and dependency rules. The Borrowed By table would need to have a composite primary key c
onsisting of both Book_ID and Memb_ID, ensuring it adheres to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

2.	Create a database called LMS and convert all the resulting logical tables from question 1 into a physical 
database design using DDL. Choose the appropriate datatype, primary and foreign keys for the attributes.  
Fill your table with some data of your choice (you can use Mockaroo to create the data). Provide detailed 
assumptions for any of your design decisions.

4.	Discuss the pros and cons of non-relational databases by choosing one of the contexts below. Explain your answers with examples. 
Discuss the various types of non-relational databases along with the scenarios suitable to use and avoid them.
